## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Import datasets using `pandas`
   - Initial exploration with `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`
   - Check for missing values and data distribution

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values  
   - Feature selection and scaling using **StandardScaler**  
   - Train-test splitting with `train_test_split`  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Correlation heatmaps (`seaborn`)  
   - Distribution plots for continuous variables  
   - Boxplots to detect outliers  

4. **Model Development**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - Hyperparameter tuning (if applied)  

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score  

6. **Insights & Recommendations**
   - Key features influencing hypertension prediction  
   - Importance of lifestyle interventions & medical monitoring
